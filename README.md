# Youtube Darkmode Fix

> [!CAUTION]
> This has been temporarily removed while I figure out why the file is pinging my antivirus

Basically I got pissed at the issue and I decided to fix it because I can.
<br>
Love being able to apply my knowledge so I dont need to wait for solutions :).
<br>
Please note that I spun this up in around 30 minutes, so it isnt perfect
<br>
There are some noticable issues, but not big enough that they bother me to fix them.
<br>
The button doesnt work at the moment and I may remove it.
